# Brute Store
⚠️ Please note that this is my first website project coded back in 2013! ⚠️

The website was assigment in Metropolia's PHP course.
I have added this to GitHub just for shits and giggles. So please don't take this seriously!
Demo can be found [here](http://brutestore.epizy.com/bs_etusivu.php)

Please enjoy this madness and if you wan't to see what I real can do check my [latest repos](https://github.com/henrikra?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=)
